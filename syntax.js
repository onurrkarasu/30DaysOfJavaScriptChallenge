     * Syntax :
    Programming languages are similar to human languages. English or many other language uses words, phrases, sentences, compound sentences
    and other more to convey a meaningful message. The english meaning of syntax is the arrangement of words and phrase to create well-formed 
    sentences in a language. The technical definition of syntax is the structure of statements in a computer language. Programming languages have syntax.
    JavaScript is a programming language and like other programming languages it has its own snytax. If we do not write a syntax that JavaScript 
    understands, it will raise different types of errors. We will explore different kinds of JavaScript errors later. For now, let us see syntax errors.
