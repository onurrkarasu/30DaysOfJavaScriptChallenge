/*
    Introduction to Data Types :
    In JavaScript and also other programming languages, there are different types of data types. The following are JavaScript primitive data types:
    String, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null and Symbol
*/

/*
   ! /  Numbers :

    * Integers : Integer (negative, zero and positive) numbers Example : -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
    * Float-point numbers: Decimal number Example : -3.5, -2.25, -1.0, 0, 1.1 ,2.2, 3.5
*/

/*
   ! /  Strings : 

   * A Collection of one or more characters between two single quotes, double quotes, or backticks.
    
    'a'
    'Asabeneh'
    "Asabeneh"
    'Finland'
    'JavaScript is a beautiful programming language'
    'I love teaching'
    'I hope you are enjoying the first day'
    `We can also create a string using a backtick`
    'A string could be just as small as one character or as big as many pages'
    'Any data type under a single quote, double quote or backtick is a string'
*/

/*
    ! Booleans :

    A boolean value either true or false. any comparisons returns a boolean value, which is either true or false.
    A boolean data type is either a true or false value.

    true // if the light is on, the value is true
    false // if the light is off, the value is false

*/

/*
    ! Undefined : 

    In JavaScript, if we don't assign a value to a variable, the value is undefined. In additon to that, if a function is not returning anything,
    it returns undefined.

    let firstName
    console.log(firstName) // undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
*/
    let firstName;
    console.log(firstName); //  undefined, because it is not assigned to a value yet


/*
    Null 
    Null in JavaScript means an empty value.
    
    let emptyValue=null;
*/  

    let emptyValue=null;

/*
    Checking Data Types : 
    To check the data type of certain variable, we use the typeof operator. See the following example.

*/
    console.log(typeof 'Asabeneh'); // String
    console.log(typeof 5); // Number
    console.log(typeof true); // boolean
    console.log(typeof null); // object type
    console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
