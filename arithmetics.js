/*
    Arithmetics  : 
    Now let us practice more writing JavaScript code using console.log() on Google Chrome console for number data types.
    In addition to the text, we can also do mathematical calculations using JavaScript. Let us do the following simple calculations.
    It is possible to write JavaScript code on Google Chrome console can directly without the console.log() function. However, it is included in this
    introduction because most of this challange would be taking place in a text editor where the usage of the function would be mandatory. You can play
    around directly with instructions on the console.

    console.log(2+3); // Addition
    console.log(3-2); // Subtraction
    console.log(2*3); // Multiplication
    console.log(3/2); // Division
    console.log(3%2); // Modulus - finding remember
    console.log(3**2); // Exponentiation 3**2==3*3
